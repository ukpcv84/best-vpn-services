## **[Ivacy VPN](https://ivacy.com)**

Affordable VPN pioneer offering split tunneling innovation and dedicated streaming servers at budget-friendly pricing.

![Ivacy VPN Screenshot](image/ivacy.webp)


Founded in 2007, this Singapore-based provider revolutionized the industry by introducing split tunneling technology back in 2010. The service maintains an extensive network spanning multiple continents with specialized servers optimized for different purposes.

**Core Protection and Protocols**

Military-grade AES-256 encryption forms the foundation, supported by multiple protocol options including WireGuard for modern devices. The secure download feature actively scans files for malware during transfers, adding an extra protection layer beyond standard VPN functionality. Users can configure split tunneling on Windows and Android to route specific apps through the encrypted tunnel while others access the internet directly.

**Server Infrastructure**

The network encompasses thousands of servers across numerous countries, providing broad geographic coverage for accessing regional content. Dedicated streaming servers exist for major platforms, though some users report occasional connection drops that require server switching. The multiport feature automatically selects optimal ports to maintain stable connections even in restrictive network environments.

**Privacy and Logging**

Based in Singapore, outside major surveillance alliances, the provider maintains a strict no-logs policy verified through its privacy documentation. The service doesn't track browsing history, connection timestamps, or original IP addresses—only minimal account information necessary for service delivery.

**Pricing Accessibility**

Monthly plans start at competitive rates, but the real value emerges with long-term commitments. Five-year subscriptions drop to approximately $1-2 per month, making this one of the most budget-conscious options available. The 30-day money-back guarantee allows risk-free testing.

**Mobile and Desktop Experience**

Apps are available for all major platforms with straightforward interfaces. The Windows client offers the most features, while Mac and iOS versions lack certain capabilities like kill switches. Connection modes simplify server selection by purpose—choose streaming, downloading, or unblocking modes rather than manually picking servers.

**Ideal Scenarios**

Best suited for budget-conscious users prioritizing value over cutting-edge features, families needing affordable protection across multiple devices, and streamers who occasionally access different regional libraries without requiring 100% consistency.

## **FAQ**

**Q: Which VPN offers the best value for long-term subscriptions?**

Services like Ivacy, Surfshark, and Private Internet Access consistently offer the strongest price-to-feature ratios when committing to two-year or longer plans. These providers drop monthly costs to $1-2 while maintaining solid security, decent speeds, and adequate server networks. The key is confirming the money-back guarantee provides sufficient testing time before the long commitment locks in.

**Q: Can I use a VPN to access streaming services from different countries?**

Most modern VPNs unblock major streaming platforms, though consistency varies. NordVPN and ExpressVPN demonstrate the highest reliability across Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and other services. Some providers like Ivacy and CyberGhost offer dedicated streaming servers optimized for specific platforms. Remember that bypassing geographic restrictions may violate streaming platform terms of service, so review those policies before proceeding.

**Q: What's the difference between free and paid VPN services?**

Free VPNs typically impose data caps, speed limitations, restricted server access, and fewer simultaneous connections. Some free services like ProtonVPN offer unlimited data but limit speeds and server choices. Others like Windscribe provide generous monthly data allowances. Paid VPNs remove these restrictions while adding advanced features like kill switches, split tunneling, and better streaming support. For daily use, paid services generally provide significantly better experiences.
